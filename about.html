              At OGCF, we believe that every person deserves the opportunity to
              live a fulfilling life.

              <br />
              <br />

              Our journey began with a simple desire to help those in need,
              particularly widows and children who are often marginalized and
              forgotten.

              <br />
              <br />

              Through our passion and dedication, we have grown from a small
              group of individuals with a shared vision to a community of
              changemakers who are making a real difference in the lives of
              those we serve.

              <br />
              <br />

              While we are a relatively new organization, we have already made a
              significant impact in the lives of those we serve. We have seen
              widows and children who were once hopeless and helpless, now
              thriving and empowered. Our journey has just begun, and we remain
              committed to making a lasting difference in our community and
              beyond.

                      Mr. Owa John Ihiabe is an accomplished young professional
                      with a diverse range of qualifications and expertise. He
                      holds a Bachelor's degree in Political Science and
                      International Relations, a Postgraduate degree in French,
                      as well as two Master's degrees in Intelligence and
                      Security, and International Relations. Additionally, he
                      has obtained professional certifications in Criminology,

                      Beyond his impressive academic achievements, Mr. Ihiabe
                      has a genuine passion for various interests. Alongside his
                      dedication to his work, he finds joy in playing football
                      and basketball, as well as engaging in security surveys
                      and watching documentaries. Coming from a prominent
                      political family in Nigeria, Mr. Ihiabe has been deeply
                      influenced by his upbringing. His drive to establish the

                      from his inherent empathy, which he attributes to his
                      father. The plight of the less privileged and widows in
                      Nigeria and other parts of the world has weighed heavily
                      on his heart since a young age. Having interacted with
                      individuals from diverse social backgrounds, ranging from
                      domestic workers to influential politicians and successful
                      business moguls, he is motivated to embark on a genuine
                      and impactful mission to bring positive change to the
                      world. Mr. Ihiabe's unwavering commitment to this cause is
                      rooted in his deep sense of purpose and faith.

                Though we are a young organization, we have already begun to
                make a difference in the lives of widows and children in
                Nigeria. We have provided support to orphanages and helped
                individuals through counseling and emotional support. As we
                continue to grow, we look forward to expanding our programs and
                making an even greater impact.
